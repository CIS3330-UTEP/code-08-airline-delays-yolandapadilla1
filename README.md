## CIS3330-CODE-7-Airline-Delays-Analysis

## Instructions

In this CODE assignment, you are going to put into practice descriptive and predictive analytics on a dataset called `Flight_Delays_2018.csv`. This dataset has information about delayed flights in 2018. Your job is to conduct descriptive and predictive analytics, as explained below.

1. Descriptive Analytics: Conduct a descriptive analysis to find shapes, patterns, and trends in the data. 
 * Your descriptive analysis should help you choose **predictors** (i.e., independent variables) for the delays in the arrivals (**"ARR_DELAY"**).
 * Your descriptive analysis should help you **reduce the scope** of your analysis in terms of airports and/or airlines.
 * In a report, include statistics and visualizations that explain why you chose certain predictors and the scope of your analysis.
2. Predictive Analytics: Create a predictive linear regression model using **"statsmodels.api"** and ordinary least squares (OLS).
 * Your predictive analytics should report a model that tries to predict delays in the arrivals (**"ARR_DELAY"**)
 * Your predictive analytics should return a report explaining how predictors explain arrivals delays.
 * In a report, include statistics and visualizations that explain what significant predictors in your analysis are and how these predictors can be used to create inferences about future observations.
 * Your report should also include 1-2 paragraphs explaining the findings from your predictive analytical model.

### Deliverables 

No automated testing is enabled in this assignment, but any code used for this assignment needs to be in `code_7.py`. For your deliverable, submit the following two things:

* Code repository with Python code and report in document format (e.g., PDF, Word, etc.)
* Descriptive and predictive analytics report also submitted in Blackboard.

## Helpful Hints

* You can find documentation outlining the contents of the dataset's columns at [https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp?gnoyr_VQ=FGJ](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp?gnoyr_VQ=FGJ)

## Useful Python Code

* Creating an OLS model with statsmodel.api
  * `model = sm.OLS(Y,X).fit()`
* Describing the statsmodel.api OLS model
  * `model.summary()`
* Obtaining parameters of the linear fit.
  * `model.params`
* Visualizing OLS model
`fig, ax = plt.subplots()`
`fig = sm.graphics.plot_fit(model_Simple, 0, ax=ax)`
`plt.show()`
* Plotting scatterplot with matplotlib
`plt.scatter(X,Y)`
`plt.show()`
